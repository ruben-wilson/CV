##  Ruben Wilson

I am a twenty-year-old junior developer. Despite what I lack in years I make up for in enthusiasm and drive. After sustaining an injury in the Royal Marine's commando training, I was left with a fractured shoulder socket and at least a year's recovery. Being frantic to find intellectual and physical stimulation, I was left with an even bigger problem: what could I do now to fulfil my thirst for a challenge? Luckily for me, I fell back in love with coding. From a young age, I have always struggled not to be obsessed with something. This enables me to give my all to many different vocations in my life. From representing London in sailing at a young age to competing and medaling at the national level x country and track running, I have always been very self-driven and tenacious in reaching my goals. I have always liked trying to break down the chaos of life into a logic which I can use to achieve goals and make sense of the complexities that make up the world around us. I believe this is why coding gives me so much pleasure. This has led me to become obsessed with writing and learning how such basic low-level logic can achieve so many truly astonishing things.

## Hobbies

I like to run and train daily. I find it useful to use exercise to control stress, motivation, and focus. I also play five-aside with friends and enjoy walking with my dog. On the other hand, when I am not doing something physical, I have a strong interest in history and art and often spend weekends touring museums and galleries.
