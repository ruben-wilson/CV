## Your Name

I am a twenty year old junior fullstack enginer, despite what i lack in years i make up for in enthusiasm and drive. After sustaining an injury in royal marines commando training, i was left with a fractured shoulder socket and atleast a years recovery. being the sort of person who is frantic to find intellectual and physical stimulation, i was left with an even bigger problem of what could i do now to fuffuil my thurst for challenge? luckily for me i feel back in love with coding. From a young age ive always struggled not to be obssesed with somthing, however this has only allowed me to give my all to lots of different vocations in my life. From representing london in sailing at a young age to competing and medaling at national level x country and track running and reresenting England, i have always been very selfdriven and tenacious in achieving my goals. I have always liked trying to break down the chaos of life into logic which i can use to achive goals and make sense of the complexitys that make the world around us, i belive this is why coding gives me so much pleasure. This has lead me to become obessed with writting and learning how such basic low level logic can achieve so many truely astonishing things.
