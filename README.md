Ruben Wilson

I am a twenty-year-old junior developer who is highly enthusiastic and driven. After sustaining an injury in the Royal Marine's commando training, I was left with a fractured shoulder socket requiring at least a year's recovery. This left me with the time to fall back in love with coding.

I've always liked to break down the chaos of life into a logic which I can use to achieve goals and make sense of the complexities that make up the world around us. I believe this is why coding gives me so much pleasure.

After spending nearly two years of life preparing for the Marines, I never expected to find myself excited to start something new. Reconnecting with my love for technology and coding has been a very rewarding journey and I am very grateful for the path I am now on.

**Determination**

**Resilience**

When things do not go as planned, I have learnt to move forward in a positive manner, finding alternatives to achieve my goals and targets.

**Team Player**

I enjoy the elevated levels of learning that can be achieved by working as a group. I also enjoy the social aspect of working in a team and love being able to use my enthusiasm to motivate those around me and lift team spirits.

**Punctuality**

I am not sure whether it was waking up early to work on the roofs or the threats of thrashings in the marines. However, I take great pride in good timekeeping. Whether it be planning my work to meet deadlines or simply arriving on time, I strive to be punctual.
